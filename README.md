# HERO ENCRYPTOR

This is a file encryptor that encrypts data using AES encryption with a 16byte key. AES is one of the securest encryptions out there.

"AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide."- wikipedia

"The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use." - National Security Agency (NSA), wikipedia


INSTRUCTIONS:

ENCRYPTING: COPY and PASTE the text you want to encrypt.

Information, PRECAUTIONS and Suggestions:

This file is capable of encrypting/decrypting a file more than 1 million words long instantly.
All encrypted files, keys and decrypted files are stored in the "Hero Encryptor" folder alongside the executable file for the application. 
This encryptor is for text only. It may say it encrypted a file with images successfully but it won't be able to decrypt the file.

Be sure to remove files and keys from "Hero Encryptor" folder after encryption/decryption process ends successfully so that they do not get overwritten accidentally. 
Store keys on some offline storage device separate from the encrypted files. It is advised to not give very generic names to the files.
